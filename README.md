# Internal Tools

Welcome to our internal tools monorepo! This repository includes tools that will help accelerate the development of both old and new projects. Below is a list of the tools included in this monorepo:

- [`react-auth-amplify`](/packages/react-auth-amplify/README.md): A package that provides authentication support for React.js (and Next.js) applications using AWS Amplify.
- [`tsconfig`](/packages/tsconfig/README.md): Two TypeScript configuration files, one for Node.js backend development and another for Next.js frontend development.
- [`eslint`](/packages/eslint/README.md): For now a template only for Next.js.

We hope that these tools will help streamline your development process, make it easier to build high-quality applications and focus on what matters! Happy coding!
